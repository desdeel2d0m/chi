## Prerequests

1. Installed and working Go environment
2. Download the sources and switch the working directory:

    ```bash
    go get -d github.com/pressly/chi
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pressly/chi
    ```

3. Now you should be able to run `make`, `make fmt`.

## Submitting a Pull request

Your typical workflow will be:

1. [Fork the repository.][fork] [This tip maybe also helpful.][go-fork-tip]
2. [Create a topic branch.][branch]
3. Add tests for your change.
4. Run `make`. If you tests pass, return to the step 3.
5. Implement the change and ensure the steps from the previous step pass.
6. Run `make fmt`, to ensure the new code conforms to Go formatting guidline.
7. [Add, commit and push your changes.][git-help] 
8. [Submit a pull request.][pull-req]
